### Translations

If you are interested in translating _PHP: The Right Way_, fork this repo on GitHub and publish your localized fork to your own GitHub Pages account. We'll link to your translation from the primary document.

To avoid fragmentation and reader confusion, please choose one of these options:

1. We link to your GitHub Pages fork with `[username].github.io/php-the-right-way`
2. We link to your GitHub Pages fork with a subdomain (e.g. "ru.phptherightway.com")

If you use a subdomain, enter the subdomain into the `CNAME` file, and ask us to setup DNS for you. If you do not use a subdomain, remove the `CNAME` file entirely else your fork will not build when pushed.

Add information about your translation in the [wiki page](https://github.com/codeguy/php-the-right-way/wiki/Translations).

When your translation is ready, open an issue on the Issue Tracker to let us know.

## Why

There's been a lot of discussion lately about how the PHP community lacks sufficient, credible information for programmers new to PHP. This repository aims to solve this problem.
