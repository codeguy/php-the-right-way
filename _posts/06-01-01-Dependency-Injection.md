# Dependency Injection {#dependency_injection_title}

From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection):

> Dependency injection is a software design pattern that allows the removal of hard-coded dependencies and makes it 
> possible to change them, whether at run-time or compile-time.

This quote makes the concept sound much more complicated than it actually is. Dependency Injection is providing a component 
with it's dependencies either through constructor injection, method calls or the setting of properties. It is that simple.
