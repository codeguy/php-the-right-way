## Components {#components_title}

As mentioned above "Components" are another approach to the common goal of creating, distributing and implementing shared code. Various 
component repositories exist, the main two of which are:

* [Packagist](/#composer_and_packagist)
* [PEAR](/#pear)

Both of these repositories have command line tools associated with them to help the installation and upgrade processes, and have been 
explained in more detail in the [Dependency Management][dm] section.

There are also component-based frameworks, which allow you to use their components with minimal (or no) requirements. For example, you 
can use the [FuelPHP Validation package][fuelval], without needing to use the FuelPHP framework itself. These projects are essentially 
just another repository for reusable components:

  [dm]: /#dependency_management
  [fuelval]: https://github.com/fuelphp/validation

* [Aura](http://auraphp.github.com/)
* [FuelPHP (2.0 only)](https://github.com/fuelphp)
* [Laravel's "Illuminate Components"](https://github.com/illuminate)
* [Symfony Components](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/index.html)
