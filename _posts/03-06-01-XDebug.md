## XDebug {#xdebug_title}

One of the most useful tools in software development is a proper debugger. It allows you to trace the execution of your
code and monitor the contents of the stack. XDebug, PHP's debugger, can be utilized by various IDEs to provide
Breakpoints and stack inspection. It can also allow tools like PHPUnit and KCacheGrind to perform code coverage analysis
and code profiling.

If you find yourself in a bind, willing to resort to var_dump/print_r, and you still can't find the solution - maybe you
need to use the debugger.

[Installing XDebug][xdebug-install] can be tricky, but one of its most important features is "Remote Debugging" - if you
develop code locally and then test it inside a VM or on another server, Remote Debugging is the feature that you will
want to enable right away.

Traditionally, you will modify your Apache VHost or .htaccess file with these values:

    php_value xdebug.remote_host=192.168.?.?
    php_value xdebug.remote_port=9000

The "remote host" and "remote port" will correspond to your local computer and the port that you configure your IDE to
listen on. Then it's just a matter of putting your IDE into "listen for connections" mode, and loading the URL:

    http://your-website.example.com/index.php?XDEBUG_SESSION_START=1

Your IDE will now intercept the current state as the script executes, allowing you to set breakpoints and probe the
values in memory.
