When you are building your application it is helpful to use common patterns in your code and common patterns for the
overall structure of your project. Using common patterns is helpful because it makes it much easier to manage your code
and lets other developers quickly understand how everything fits together.

If you use a framework then most of the higher level code and project structure will be based on that framework, so a
lot of the pattern decisions are made for you. But it is still up to you to pick out the best patterns to follow in the
code you build on top of the framework. If, on the other hand, you are not using a framework to build your application
then you have to find the patterns that best suit the type and size of application that you're building.
