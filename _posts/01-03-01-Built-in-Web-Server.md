## Built-in web server {#builtin_web_server_title}

With PHP 5.4 or newer, you can start learning PHP without installing and configuring a full-fledged web server.
To start the server, run the following command from your terminal in your project's web root:

{% highlight console %}
> php -S localhost:8000
{% endhighlight %}
