## Use the Current Stable Version (7.4) {#use_the_current_stable_version_title}

If you are getting started with PHP, start with the current stable release of [PHP 7.4][php-release]. PHP 7.x adds many [new features](#language_highlights) over the older 5.x versions. The engine has been largely re-written, and PHP is now even quicker than older versions.

You should try to upgrade to the latest stable version quickly - PHP 5.6 [is already End of Life](http://php.net/supported-versions.php).  Upgrading is easy, as there are not many [backwards compatibility breaks][php74-bc]. If you are not sure which version a function or feature is in, you can check the PHP documentation on the [php.net][php-docs] website.
