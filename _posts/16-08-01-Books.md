## Books {#books_title}

There are a lot of books around for PHP but some are sadly now quite old and no longer contain accurate information.
There are even books published for "PHP 6" which does not exist, and will not now ever exist. The next major version of
PHP will be named "PHP 7" because of those books.

This section aims to be a living document for recommended books on PHP development in general. If you would like your
book to be added, send a PR and it will be reviewed for relevancy.
